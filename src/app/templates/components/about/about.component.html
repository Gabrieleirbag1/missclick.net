      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Gabriel, and I've been passionate about programming since my first year of studies.
        Over the years, I have built experience in web development, software engineering, video game creation, and DevOps.
      </p>
      <p>I enjoy exploring new technologies and appreciate how the ever-evolving field of IT constantly challenges me to learn and grow.
        I love the logical side of programming and thinking about how to design optimized, efficient solutions.
        I also take great pleasure in creating applications that are both user-friendly and visually appealing, reflecting my personal style.
      </p>
      <p> In my free time, I'm passionate about video games, playing the piano, and esports.
        I also really enjoy socializing, expanding my knowledge, and developing my own perspectives on a wide range of topics.
